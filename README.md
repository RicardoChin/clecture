This project is to share the "C Programming" course slides written in Latex. The slides are fully written and organized by me. It is designed for the first year undergraduate student. 

## Compile
One can compile every lecture slides with "pdflatex" smoothly.

## Copyright Issue
Any one who receives these slides and material are free to use them. BUT when one shows them in any form for lectures one should point out that "<bf> they are from Wan-Lei Zhao, China</bf>".
