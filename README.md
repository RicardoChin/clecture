## Lecture Slides for C Programming

This project shares the "C Programming" course slides (in English) written with Latex. The slides are fully written and organized by Wan-Lei Zhao (from Xiamen University, China). This course is targeted to the first year undergraduate student. There are around 521 slides in total.


## Syllabus
#### Lecture 1 Introduction to Computer and Programming
#### Lecture 2 Binary, Octal and hexadexical Codes, Data Types and Basic Operators
#### Lecture 3 Sequential and Conditional Control
#### Lecture 4 Loops
#### Lecture 5 Functions and Macros
#### Lecture 6 Array and String
#### Lecture 7 struct, union and enum
#### Lecture 8 Pointers
#### Lecture 9 File Operation
#### Lecture 10 Bitwise Operation
#### Lecture 11 make and Makefile


## Compile
One can compile slides of every lecture with "pdflatex" smoothly. For example
```
pdflatex lec1.tex
```

## Copyright Issue
Any one who receives these slides and material is free to use them. BUT when one shows them in any form or in any situation, one should point out that "**they are designed by Wan-Lei Zhao from China**". By the way, I am looking for the collaborators who are willing to contribute. For anyone who would like to join in the project, please contact with me via email stonescx@gmail.com.

## Exercises for the course
If one wants to get the exercises I designed for this course, please send email to me. Please be noted that I will only share my exercises with teachers. So the one who sends me the request should prove himself/herself a teacher first.
